# Currency-converter

This is 3 project in my training and 2 independent project.
I created my first currency Converter with the ability to work with the API.
I used HTML, CSS, and JS to work with this project and admit it wasn't easy for me.
The work took three 8-hour working days if you calculate the total time.
The first day was spent writing HTML and CSS.
After I made a beautiful picture, started working on the necessary functionality. I thought and painted for myself the algorithm of my currency Converter and started writing JS. But during the development process, it happened more than once that I had to redo the functionality because I didn't think through a lot of small things at once.=)
At the end of the third day, after checking my project according to the terms of reference, I realized that I had succeeded.
This is another small victory for me. I hope this will be useful to You.
